# Udacity - MyReads Application w/ React project

This application was built as a project for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program. This application allows a user to search for books and place them on a virtual book shelf. There are three bookshelfs available:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

After seraching and selecting the book of your choice, the book will be displayed on its corresponding shelf.

## Installation
To view the source code for the application

* `cd` into a folder of your choice in your terminal and 
* use `git clone https://github.com/chrisvneal/udacity_my-reads.git` 
to download the files
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`

## Start the application


* start the development server with `npm start`
* wait for the server to open up your default browser and display on `localhost:3000`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
